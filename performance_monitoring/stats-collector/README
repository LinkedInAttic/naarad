This package installs some scripts in /export/content/data/perf that
do performance monitoring against sar at 2 second intervals, also captures /proc/meminfo, /proc/vmstat and /proc/zoneinfo.
It will then schedule cron.d jobs to periodically dumps performance logs to that directory. 
Every day's logs are put in a separate subdirectory, whose name is the date. 
Logs older than 8 days will be removed. 
It will first tries to install with 'app' user account; if 'app' does not exist, it will use 'root' instead.
